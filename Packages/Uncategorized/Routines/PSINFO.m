 Q
V1 ;VERSION 1
 ;     THIS IS THE VERSION WHICH DOES NOT CONFORM TO NAMESPACE CONVENTIONS,
 ;I.E., THE DRUGS ARE IN ^DRUG, THE SCRIPTS IN ^RX, ETC.  PROGRAMS AND
 ;DATA DICTIONARIES WILL MAKE REFERENCE TO THESE GLOBALS.  DO NOT USE IF
 ;YOU ARE JUST BEGINNING TO INSTALL THE PHARMACY PACKAGE.
 ;
V2 ;VERSION 2
 ;     THIS VERSION HOLDS ALL PHARMACY DATA IN GLOBALS BEGINNING WITH PS.
 ;THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS ARE A FEW TABLES HELD IN ^DIC, AND, OF COURSE, THE
 ;PATIENT DATA HELD IN ^DPT.  THE SECOND MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS THE MOVE TO
 ;PROCESSING BY PATIENT, THAT IS, PATIENT DATA IS GATHERED ONCE FOR MANY
 ;SCRIPTS.  ON-LINE PHARMACIST REVIEW OF THE PROFILE AND THE RENEWAL OF
 ;PRESCRIPTIONS IS AVAILABLE IN THIS VERSION.  THE CONVERSION FROM VERSION
 ;1 TO VERSION 2 IS NOT A SIMPLE TASK.  A PROGRAM CALLED PSZSW EXISTS
 ;WHICH MOVES MASSES OF DATA INTO THE PS-NAMESPACE, BUT IT DOES NOT MAKE
 ;THE COMPLETE CONVERSION.
 ;
V3 ;VERSION 3
 ;     VERSION 3 HAS NO MAJOR DATABASE DIFFERENCES FROM VERSION 2.
 ;FUNCTIONALLY, THE PACKAGE HAS EXPANDED SIGNIFICANTLY.  THERE ARE A
 ;SERIES OF SUSPENSE FUNCTIONS WHICH ALLOW GREATER CONTROL OVER SCRIPTS
 ;PUT ON SUSPENSE.  THE ASSIGNMENT OF PRESCRIPTION NUMBERS HAS BEEN EXPANDED
 ;TO RENEWALS AND NARCOTICS.  AUTOMATIC SUSPENSION OF FUTURE FILLS MAY BE
 ;IMPLEMENTED AS WELL AS AUTOMATIC CANCELLATION OF PRESCRIPTIIONS ON ADMISSION
 ;TO THE HOSPITAL.  EXPIRATION LOGIC ACCOUNTS FOR YEAR-LONG SCRIPTS AND
 ;SHORT TERM PRESCRIPTIONS.  AMIS AND DISPENSING REPORTS ARE IMPROVED AND
 ;DESIGNED TO RUN OFF OF A DATE INDEX FOR SPEEDIER OUTPUT.  EDITS OF
 ;PRESCRIPTIONS ARE DOCUMENTED IN THE ACTIVITY LOG, SHOWING WHICH FIELDS
 ;AND WHAT THE FORMER CONTENTS WERE.  AUTOMATIC ASSIGNMENT OF CLERK CODES
 ;CAN ALSO BE IMPLEMENTED.
 ;
 ;VERSION 3.1
 ;     THIS IS AN UPDATE TO VERSION 3 WHICH CORRECTS BUGS FOUND AFTER
 ;INSTALLATION OF VERSION 3.  THE SIGNIFICANT ADDITION IS A SERIES OF
 ;COST REPORTS DESCRIBING HOW THE PHARMACY IS SPENDING THEIR MONEY.
