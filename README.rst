.. title: FOIA VistA M Components

=======================
FOIA VistA M Components
=======================

This source tree holds a reference copy of M components for VistA, the
Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture.  It
is maintained by OSEHRA, the Open Source Electronic Health Record Agent.

This version of VistA was released by US DVA via FOIA.

-------
Purpose
-------

This source tree contains a static representation of VistA M
components exported for representation on the host filesystem.
VistA is built on a database platform that houses both code and data
so it requires programmatic operations to apply changes while
maintaining consistency.  See the OSEHRA `VistA Source Tree`_ for
tools to load these VistA components into a M database and for patches
that may be applied to a running VistA instance to keep it up to date.

------
Layout
------

The source tree is organized as follows:

* `<Packages.csv>`__: A spreadsheet recording VistA packages.  For each
  package it has a name, namespaces, file numbers and names, and a
  directory name for this source tree.

* ``Packages/<package>/Routines/``: Holds M routine ``.m`` sources.

* ``Packages/<package>/Globals/``: Holds M global ``.zwr`` files.
  M globals are organized into host files by FileMan file.
  Each ``.zwr`` file is either named ``<num>+<name>.zwr`` for
  FileMan file number ``<num>`` with name ``<name>`` or named
  ``<gbl>.zwr`` for a ``<gbl>`` global not holding a FileMan file.
